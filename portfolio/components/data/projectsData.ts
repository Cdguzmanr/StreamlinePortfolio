This included world modeling, menu design, camera movement, animations, and overall game functionality. \n\nThe game idea was designed around the camera movement and animation. I aimed to showcase a park-themed environment with in-game objects acting as interactive menus for a better immersive experience.`,

    summary: "A major refactoring and optimization project to improve the loading speed and usability of NCJTC's payments page, reducing load times in half, and implementing new features for a smoother user experience.",
    description: `As the main software engineer at the **National Criminal Justice Training Center (NCJTC)**, I identified and resolved a critical performance issue with the organization's payments page. Previously, users had to wait up to half a minute for the page to load, often causing browsers to freeze or mark the site as *“not responding.”* This issue stemmed from synchronous JavaScript calls and inefficient controller logic that attempted to load all data (registrations, organizations, and payment requests) upfront.
    \n\nTo address this, I **redesigned the page's backend and frontend workflows:**
    \n- Refactored the **Payments controller** to handle large datasets asynchronously, loading the BillMyOrg modal and Payment History section in the background.
    \n- Implemented **loading placeholder animations** to provide a smoother user experience while data loads.
    \n- Optimized JavaScript functions and controller methods, allowing the **Payments Page to load instantly**, and cutting the **data load time by more than half**.
    \n\nThis project transformed one of NCJTC's most important user-facing features into a fast, reliable, and user-friendly payment system. It showcased my ability to work independently on a large-scale .NET application, applying skills in performance optimization, asynchronous programming, JavaScript refactoring, and full-stack debugging.`,
